## Our Pledge
We as contributors, maintainers, and members of the Helixque community pledge to make participation in our project and community a safe, respectful, and welcoming experience for everyone.  
We are committed to creating an environment free from harassment, discrimination, and hostilityâ€”regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
